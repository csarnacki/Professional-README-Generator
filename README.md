# Professional README Generator Starter Code

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)


This project is designed for creating a generated README file using JavaScript and Node.js. It also uses npm, specifically version 8.2.4 to install packages such as fs and inquirer. The project asks the user a series of questions that can be answered in the terminal using Node.js and those answers are then used to generate the README file by using the fs package to write text to an external file.

The user can then preview the README and see that it contains all the information they included as well as a table of contents that allows them to jump to a certain part of the page.
